        </ul>

        <h2>Setting Up the Game:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the board in the center of the table with the card decks next to it.</li>
            <li>Each player chooses a game piece and places it on the starting space.</li>
            <li>Deal 5 cards to each player and add the protection cards to the draw deck.</li>
            <li>Shuffle each card deck.</li>
            <li>Start playing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Turn Structure:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Draw Phase:</strong> The player draws a card.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-card Phase:</strong> The player may play a bonus card or a malus card.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement Phase:</strong> The player rolls a die and moves their piece forward the number of
                spaces
                shown.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Effect Phase:</strong> The player resolves the effect of the space they landed on.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-card Phase:</strong> The player may play another bonus card or malus card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Spaces:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Draw Space:</strong> Draw a card from the draw deck.</li>
            <li><strong>Trap Space:</strong> Draw a card from the trap deck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Space Rules:</h2>
        <h3>DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The DMZ is a safe zone where players cannot be targeted by card effects.</li>
            <li>To advance, they must correctly answer a quiz question.</li>
            <li>When a player enters the DMZ, they draw a quiz card and must answer it.</li>
            <li>If they answer correctly, they can move forward on their next turn. If they answer incorrectly, they
                must
                answer another quiz question on their next turn before they can advance.</li>
            <li>DMZ Rules:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a player must move back and reaches the DMZ, they must answer another quiz question to advance.
                </li>
                <li>A player in the DMZ cannot be targeted by others.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cards:</h2>
        <h3>Types of Cards:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bonus Card:</strong> Provides a positive effect to the targeted player.</li>
            <li><strong>Malus Card:</strong> Applies a negative effect to the targeted opponent.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection Card:</strong> Grants protection against a specific type of card.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Card Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malus:</strong> A player can only be affected by one card of a given type at a time (for
                example, a
                player cannot be hit by two "virus" cards simultaneously).</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> When a player uses a protection card, they become immune to the associated
                card
                type until they reach the next SAS. Once they reach that point, the protection card is discarded. A
                player
                can have only one active protection card at a time.</li>
        </ul>

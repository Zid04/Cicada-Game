            <h1>Cicada-3032: The Cybersecurity Board Game Rules</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to Cicada-3032</h2>
            <p>Cicada-3032 is a board game centered around cybersecurity in which players compete to be the first to
                reach
                the center of the board. To achieve this, you will use Bonus cards to protect and benefit yourself, and
                Penalty cards to slow down or block your opponents as they progress across the board.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entering the DMZ:</strong> When a player enters the DMZ, they must immediately draw a Quiz
                    card
                    and answer it. If they answer correctly, they may move forward on their next turn; otherwise, they
                    must
                    answer another Quiz card on their next turn before they can advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Back:</strong> If a player must move back several spaces and lands in or passes
                    through
                    the DMZ, they must still answer a Quiz card to be allowed to advance on a future turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> A player currently inside the DMZ cannot be targeted by other players'
                    cards.
